# wp-overlay-restaurant

wp-overlay-restaurant combines a small page builder with an overlay search. It ships a custom meta box powered by [CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2) to create flexible fullwidth or grid modules on pages or posts. A simple JavaScript powered overlay search is included to search through a small data set which can be replaced with your own items.

## Features

- Add repeating modules to pages and posts (fullwidth sections or 2Ã—2 grids)
- Choose between predefined layout patterns or build custom sequences
- Shortcode `[free_flexio_modules]` renders the modules and the overlay search
- Overlay search shows results in a centered modal

## Requirements

The plugin relies on the CMB2 library. If CMB2 isn't available the builder tries
to install the latest version automatically from WordPress.org. You can also
install CMB2 manually or copy the library into `includes/cmb2/` so that
`includes/cmb2/init.php` exists.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to your WordPress installation and activate it.
2. The plugin attempts to fetch CMB2 on activation. If that fails, install CMB2
   manually (see **Requirements**).
3. Version 2.2.1 improves stability when the shortcode runs outside the main
   query by checking that a valid post is available.
4. Create or edit a page/post and configure modules via the **Page Modules** meta
   box.
5. Insert the shortcode `[free_flexio_modules]` into the content where the
   modules and search should appear.

## Customising the search

Edit `assets/script.js` to replace the sample array of items with your own data or modify the overlay markup inside `includes/render-modules.php`.
