# wp-overlay-restaurant

wp-overlay-restaurant is a small page builder. It ships a custom meta box powered by [CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2) to create flexible fullwidth or grid modules on pages or posts. If CMB2 is missing, a lightweight fallback meta box is used instead.

## Features

- Add repeating modules to pages and posts (fullwidth sections or 2Ã—2 grids)
- Choose between predefined layout patterns or build custom sequences
- Selecting a predefined pattern now auto-populates matching modules for quick editing
- Shortcode `[free_flexio_modules]` renders the modules
- Create reusable layouts in the **Overlay Layouts** menu and reference them via `[free_flexio_modules id="123"]` (or by slug, e.g. `[free_flexio_modules id="startseite"]`)
- Overlay layout lists in the admin now show the shortcode for each layout

## Requirements

The plugin works best with the CMB2 library. When CMB2 is not present a simplified built-in meta box is loaded. You can still install the CMB2 plugin or copy the library into `includes/cmb2/` so that `includes/cmb2/init.php` exists to use the full CMB2 interface.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to your WordPress installation and activate it.
2. Install and activate the CMB2 plugin if it isn't already present.
3. Version 2.6.2 bundles a fallback meta box so the plugin works even without CMB2.
4. Create a new entry under **Overlay Layouts** and configure modules via the **Page Modules** meta box.
5. Insert the shortcode `[free_flexio_modules id="123"]` on any page, replacing `123` with the layout ID. Slugs work as well, e.g. `[free_flexio_modules id="startseite"]`.
